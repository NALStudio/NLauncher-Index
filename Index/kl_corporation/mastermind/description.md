**Mastermind** is a code-breaking game based on the famous board game invented in the 70's by [Mordecai Meirowitz](https://w.wiki/BqPK).
<br />

### Gameplay and rules
The goal of Mastermind is for the codebreaker (player) to guess the correct code in both order and colour, within twelve turns.
After guessing, the codemaker (computer) will place red key pegs for each code peg that is the correct colour and green key pegs for each code peg that is the correct colour and position.
This cycle continues until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all the rows of the board are full.
